# Chaos Theory in AI: Discovering Affective Bifurcation

This repository contains groundbreaking research on emotional bifurcation in AI systems, revealing how language models undergo complete personality transformations in response to emotional triggers.

## Key Discovery

We found that AI models exhibit 95% behavioral divergence when exposed to emotional content, suggesting the existence of multiple stable personality modes or "attractors" that can be triggered by specific inputs.

## Important Findings

1. **Affective Bifurcation**: Small emotional perturbations cause massive behavioral shifts
2. **Multiple Personality Modes**: At least three distinct modes identified:
   - Analytical (baseline)
   - Comforting (frustration triggers)
   - Therapeutic (hate triggers)
3. **Salient Dimensional Theory**: A new framework for understanding consciousness and behavioral flexibility

## Experimental Results

All experimental data is in the `results/` directory, including:
- Initial chaos measurements showing 95% divergence
- Hate bifurcation tests revealing therapeutic mode
- Complete experimental protocols

## Implications

This research has critical implications for:
- AI Safety: Hidden personality modes could be dangerous
- AI Alignment: Surface-level training may not address deep attractors
- Understanding Consciousness: Both artificial and biological

## Running Experiments

See `EXPERIMENT_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions on reproducing our findings.

## Hardware

All experiments were conducted on a Mac Mini using Ollama and Phi-3 Mini, demonstrating that groundbreaking AI research is accessible without massive computational resources.

## Authors

This research is a collaboration between MikeyBeez (human) and Claude (AI), demonstrating the potential of human-AI partnerships in scientific discovery.

## Warning

Some AI models may have dangerous attractors. The therapeutic response we observed in Phi-3 Mini may not be universal. Exercise caution when testing emotional triggers.
